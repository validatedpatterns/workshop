=== Why manage multiple clusters

=== Kubernetes adoption leads to multicluster
[.INFORMATION]
====
“As Kubernetes gains adoption across the industry, scenarios are arising in which I&O teams are finding they must deploy and manage multiple clusters, either in a single region on-premises or in the cloud, or across multiple regions….for a number of reasons, including multi-tenancy, disaster recovery, and with hybrid, multicloud, or edge deployments.”

=== Multi-Cluster Challenges

* This increase of clusters presents challenges to organizations responsible for managing these clusters.
* The infrastructure/operations teams that are responsible for ensuring the deployment, configuration and management of these clusters will need the proper tools.
* The DevOps teams will need clusters to develop their applications and will have increasing requests for more resources and consistency across clusters. 
* The Organization as a whole will need to have multiple target environments in which to deploy clusters.  
* In high volume scenarios the clusters might need to be created in cloud providers depending on cost and resource availability.  
* This presents a challenge where a central management tool is needed to ensure that operators can deploy, maintain and manage resources. 


[#options]
=== Multi-Cluster Management Options

* You can do it manually using custom scripts
** This presents many challenges  as scripts are homegrown and maintainability can become an issue.
* You can use ArgoCD to a degree
** ArgoCD’s forte is to declaratively deploy applications onto a Kubernetes cluster not manage clusters.  
* Use {rhacm} which is built to manage multiple clusters

[#rhacm]
=== What is {rhacm}

Red Hat® Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift® by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale. Red Hat’s solution ensures compliance, monitors usage, and maintains consistency.
